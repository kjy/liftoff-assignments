### Overview
The motivation for this message tracking app came form the pandemic as a way to provide self-care to those experiencing hard times. This app provides a way for people to track and refer back to their own uplifting and positive messages as a way to motivate and inspire themselves to stay focused, to have a positive outlook, and to move forward in life.  The user will first register, allowing for login authentication. Next, the user will be able to view, create, modify and delete messages.   This app will allow the user to track their own messages for their own interest.  Another feature includes a gallery of images that have caption messages.  Finally, the app includes pulling and displaying weather data.
