## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Have you ever wanted someone to send you an optimistic or cheery message on a rainy day? The idea for this project came from wanting to motivate and inspire people during the pandemic. The user will first register for a new account, with validation of email. Next, the user will be able to view all messages, create new messages, as well as modify and delete messages.   This app will allow the user to track their own messages for their own interest, like a reminder or a mantra. Finally, the user can also send their messages to themselves or to friends via a push notification. This app may also include a search and find friend feature.  A web app that tracks motivational and inspirational messages.
